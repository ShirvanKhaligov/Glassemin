Glassemin
=========

Glassemin is an app for Google Glass that utilizes the light sensor to create a virtual "theremin". Move your hand back and forth from the camera to change the pitch of the sound.

Since Android only updates the light sensor every few seconds, there is a slight delay between hand movement and pitch update.
